# Manus Principles: Why Planning-with-Files Works

Six principles that make file-based planning effective for complex tasks.

## 1. KV-Cache: Establish Context Early

**Do**: Create task_plan.md at the start, front-load goals and constraints.

**Example**: Write task_plan.md in turn 2, reference it throughout—don't try to summarize 30 turns later.

---

## 2. Mask Don't Remove: Append, Don't Edit

**Do**: Add new rows to tables, don't modify past entries. When things change, explain the change.

**Example**: Add "Changed decision on X because Y" rather than editing the original decision.

---

## 3. Filesystem as External Memory

**Do**: Put critical context in files—they persist across sessions, memory doesn't.

**Example**: Read task_plan.md to see "we chose X because Y" rather than relying on recall.

---

## 4. Recitation Brings Focus

**Do**: Before major decisions, reread planning files. Use the 5-Question Reboot Check when resuming.

**Example**: "Let me read task_plan.md... goal is X, phase Y, decided Z" before making changes.

---

## 5. Keep Wrong Stuff In

**Do**: Log all errors and failed approaches. Add resolutions, don't erase mistakes.

**Example**: Add "Switched to OAuth—API key failed due to rate limits" rather than deleting the failed attempt.

---

## 6. Don't Get Few-Shotted

**Do**: Vary your documentation format. Adapt to what you learn.

**Example**: Sometimes bullets, sometimes prose, sometimes tables—avoid ritualistic sameness.

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| KV-Cache | Create task_plan.md first, establish goal early |
| Mask Don't Remove | Append to tables, don't edit past entries |
| Filesystem = Memory | All critical context lives in files |
| Recitation | Read-before-decide rule, 5-Question Reboot |
| Keep Wrong In | Errors table tracks failures with resolutions |
| Don't Few-Shot | Vary format, adapt to what you learn |
