## Overview

**Target:** [Earlyvangelist segment]

**Core hypothesis being tested:** [Problem hypothesis summary]

## Pre-Build Tasks

Complete these before writing code:

### Interviews

- [ ] **Interview 5 potential earlyvangelists about the problem**
  - Goal: Validate problem exists and is painful enough
  - Questions:
    - "Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]"
    - "What did you do about it?"

## During-Build Tasks

Complete these while building the MVP:

### Ongoing Feedback

- [ ] **Share weekly progress with 3 earlyvangelists**
  - Goal: Get input on direction, catch mistakes early
  - Format: Quick demo, screenshots, or Loom video
  - Ask: "Does this match what you need? What's missing?"

- [ ] **Recruit 5 beta users from target segment**
  - Goal: Have users ready when MVP launches
  - Channels: [Where to find them based on customer profile]
  - Incentive: [Early access, discount, input on roadmap]

### Assumption Testing

- [ ] **Test [specific assumption] with [method]**
  - Assumption: [What we're betting on]
  - Test: [How we'll validate]
  - Decision: If wrong, we will [pivot/adjust/continue]
