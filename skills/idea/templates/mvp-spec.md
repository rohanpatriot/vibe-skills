## What This MVP is NOT

To maintain focus:

- This is NOT a complete product - it's a learning tool
- This is NOT for mainstream users - it's for earlyvangelists
- This is NOT the final version - it will evolve based on feedback

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Complete customer development tasks (see custdev-tasks.md)
- [ ] Set up build planning with `/planning-setup`
- [ ] [Other preparation steps]
