# Market Types

The type of market you're entering changes everything about how you compete, sell, and grow. Misidentifying your market type leads to wrong strategies.

## Three Market Types

### 1. Existing Market

**Definition:** Products already exist solving similar problems for similar customers.

**Characteristics:**
- Competitors are known and have defined features
- Customers understand the category and know what they want
- Competition is on performance: faster, better, cheaper
- Market size is knowable from existing data

**Strategy implications:**
- Position against competitors on specific dimensions
- Sales cycle is shorter (customers know what they're buying)
- Launch can be noisier (category awareness exists)
- Competition is fierce; need clear differentiation
- Risk: getting crushed by incumbents with more resources

**Earlyvangelist profile:**
- Frustrated users of existing solutions
- Power users hitting limits of current tools
- Price-sensitive buyers underserved by premium options

**Example:** A new project management tool competing with Asana/Monday/Jira

---

### 2. New Market

**Definition:** No products currently exist for this problem/solution. You're creating a category.

**Characteristics:**
- No direct competitors (maybe indirect/substitute solutions)
- Customers don't know they need this yet
- Competition is against non-consumption or DIY
- Market size is unknown and must be projected

**Strategy implications:**
- Educate customers that the problem exists/matters
- Sales cycle is long (two sales: problem + solution)
- Launch should be quiet; focus on earlyvangelists
- Category creation is expensive but winner-take-most
- Risk: market never materializes or takes longer than runway

**Earlyvangelist profile:**
- Visionaries who see the future you're building
- People with acute pain others don't recognize
- Risk-tolerant buyers willing to try unproven solutions

**Example:** Early cloud computing before "cloud" was a category

### 3. Resegmented Market

**Definition:** Taking an existing market and targeting a specific segment with different positioning.

**Two flavors:**

#### Low-Cost Resegmentation
- Offer "good enough" at lower price
- Target customers overserved by existing solutions
- Strip features mainstream doesn't use
- Example: Southwest Airlines vs. full-service carriers

#### Niche Resegmentation
- Offer specialized solution for underserved segment
- Target customers with specific needs mainstream ignores
- Add features/positioning that matter to the niche
- Example: Shopify for small merchants vs. enterprise e-commerce

**Strategy implications:**
- Must define segment clearly (who you're for AND not for)
- Positioning is everything; same product can succeed or fail based on how it's framed
- Incumbent response depends on segment attractiveness
- Risk: segment too small, or incumbents adapt

**Earlyvangelist profile (low-cost):**
- Price-conscious buyers
- Small businesses or individuals priced out
- Users who only need basic functionality

**Earlyvangelist profile (niche):**
- Specialists with unique requirements
- Users poorly served by one-size-fits-all solutions
- Buyers willing to pay premium for specialized fit

## How to Identify Your Market Type

### Signals of Existing Market
- You can name 3+ direct competitors
- Customers compare you to specific alternatives
- Feature comparison matrices are relevant
- "Better Asana" or "Faster Jira" positioning makes sense

### Signals of New Market
- Customers say "I've never seen anything like this"
- You struggle to explain it in terms of existing categories
- Competitors are doing different things entirely
- You're creating vocabulary to describe the space

### Signals of Resegmented Market
- You can name competitors but think "they don't serve [segment] well"
- Your differentiation is who you target, not just features
- Customers say "finally, something for people like us"
- Incumbents could serve this segment but choose not to

## Why This Matters

**Wrong positioning = wrong strategy = failure**

| If you think... | But you're actually in... | What goes wrong |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Existing | New | Spend on marketing no one understands |
| New | Existing | Ignore competitors who crush you |
| Existing | Resegmented | Compete on features when positioning matters |
| Resegmented | New | Over-explain when niche already knows the problem |

## Market Type Changes Over Time

Markets evolve:
- New markets become existing markets as categories mature
- Existing markets get resegmented as needs diverge
- Resegmented niches can become their own existing markets

Your market type at MVP may differ from where you end up. Reassess as you learn.
