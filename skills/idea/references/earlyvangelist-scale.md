# Earlyvangelist Pain Scale

Earlyvangelists are your first customers—visionary early adopters who feel the pain acutely and will co-develop your solution with you. They're not mainstream customers; they're weird in the best way.

## The 5-Level Pain Scale

| Level | Label | Customer Behavior | What It Means for You |
|-------|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **1** | Latent | Don't know they have the problem | Market requires education. Long cycle. High risk. |
| **2** | Passive | Aware of problem, live with it | Know the pain but not motivated to act. Need activation event. |
| **3** | Active | Seeking solutions, researching | Looking for answers but haven't committed resources. |
| **4** | Urgent | Built workarounds, DIY solutions | **Earlyvangelist territory.** Pain is real, they're hacking solutions. |
| **5** | Critical | Allocated budget, paying for imperfect solutions | **Ideal earlyvangelists.** Money on the table, desperate for better. |

## For MVP Success: Target Level 4-5

Levels 1-3 require you to convince customers they have a problem before you can sell them a solution. That's two sales, not one.

Level 4-5 customers:
- Already believe in the problem
- Have evidence of paying (time/money) to solve it
- Will tolerate imperfect solutions
- Give useful feedback because they understand the domain
- Become evangelists when you solve their pain

## The Five Earlyvangelist Characteristics

True earlyvangelists exhibit all five:

1. **Has the problem** - They experience the pain firsthand, not theoretically
2. **Knows they have it** - They can articulate the problem and its impact
3. **Has been actively seeking a solution** - They've looked for alternatives
4. **Has budget authority** - They can pay or influence the purchase decision
5. **Has cobbled together a workaround** - They've built something themselves

### Scoring Earlyvangelists

When evaluating a potential customer segment:

| Characteristic | Strong Signal | Weak Signal |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Has the problem | Can describe specific recent incidents | Speaks abstractly or hypothetically |
| Knows they have it | Immediately recognizes the problem | Needs explanation to see it |
| Seeking solution | Has tried alternatives, knows landscape | Hasn't looked or doesn't know options |
| Has budget | Controls budget or has sign-off authority | Would need to convince others |
| Built workaround | Shows you their spreadsheet/script/hack | Says "we just deal with it" |

## Finding Earlyvangelists

**Where to look:**
- Forums/communities where people discuss the problem
- Users of competitor products (especially complainers)
- People sharing DIY solutions on GitHub, blogs, social
- Attendees at conferences/meetups for the domain
- Your own network (but be careful of false positives from friends)

**How to identify quickly:**
- Ask "How do you handle [problem] today?"
- Level 4-5 will describe their workaround unprompted
- Level 1-3 will shrug or give vague answers

## Why This Matters

Building for mainstream users (level 1-3) before validating with earlyvangelists is the #1 cause of startup failure. You'll build features no one asked for, get lukewarm feedback, and run out of runway before finding product-market fit.

Earlyvangelists:
- Give you a shorter feedback cycle
- Help you prioritize features that matter
- Become your first references and case studies
- Often have networks of similar customers
- Forgive your mistakes because they need you to succeed
