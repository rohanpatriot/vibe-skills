# Vibe Skills

You don't need to be a developer. You need to ship.

I'm not here to teach you to code. I'm here to make sure you don't have to. Vibecoding is simple: you say what you want, Claude builds it. But Claude has a memory problem. Context slips. Mistakes repeat. Projects go sideways.

These skills fix that.

## Get In

```bash
npx skills add rohanpatriot/vibe-skills
```

## What You Get

### planning-setup

When the project gets real—multiple moving pieces, sessions that span days, complexity that would make most people tap out—you need structure. This gives Claude a system. Goals. Phases. A record of what worked and what didn't.

```bash
/planning-setup
```

Creates:
- `task_plan.md` — The goal. The phase. The decisions.
- `findings.md` — Everything Claude learns along the way.
- `progress.md` — Session by session. What happened. What's next.
- Rules that force Claude to actually use these files.

No more starting from zero every session. No more repeating the same dead ends.

## Why I Built This

Most people quit when projects get complicated. Not because they lack vision—because their tools lose the thread.

Claude is good. But Claude forgets. These skills give it a system so it doesn't.

You focus on the outcome. Claude handles the execution. This makes sure nothing falls through the cracks.

That's the edge.
